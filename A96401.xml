            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

Yea and they ſet up covetous Prieſts, who were greedy after gain, as ravening wolves, and they prophane the holy things that were conſecrated under the Law: For the ſervice of the outward Temple which God comands, and even abuſed the outward things that ſtood in the ſhadow, by their curſed inventions, and in ſerving ſtrange Gods; There was a time when Gods preſence, and of his vertues was found in the Temple that <hi>Solomon</hi> builded, and in the outward things that he comanded which ſhadowed forth the heavenly things; But when <hi>Iſrael</hi> fell into Idola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try, and offered incenſe and ſacrifices, and built up high places to worſhip ſtrange Gods in, then the Lord forſook them, and forſook the Temple and outward things which he had commanded, accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding as he promiſed, Read 2 <hi>Kings</hi> 18. &amp; 2 <hi>Cron</hi> 7.

                  <p>As alſo, that this Chriſt was immediately taken from the Diſciples into heaven, which while ſome men of <hi>Galilee</hi> ſtood gazing, they ſaw Jeſus taken, out of their ſight, and that this Chriſt who, was and is the word which made all things, which became fleſh, as is declared, who deſcended from the Father of ſpirits and life, is now aſcended and is on the right hand of power and of God who is the All power, we have the teſtimonies both of faithful men and An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels; and the life of Jeſus in us, which is the light of men, which beareth witneſs to theſe things; And all theſe things concerning Jeſus came to paſſe ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the determinate Councel of God <hi>that the Scriptures might be fulfilled;</hi> though wicked Prieſts and profeſſors, who had the Prophets words and were ſhut up in the unbelief, were fitted in their iniquity, as inſtruments of cruelty, to fulfill their iniquity in theſe hard proceedings againſt Chriſt, And that theſe things were true, that <hi>Chriſt is aſcen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded

<pb n="43" facs="tcp:173004:24"/>my name they ſhall caſt out devils, they ſhall ſpeak with new tongues, they ſhall take up ſerpents, and if they drink any deadly thing it ſhall not hurt them, they ſhall lay hands on the ſick and they ſhall recover, Mar</hi> 16.15. and this his promiſe was fulfilled and confirmed to ſeveral that believed, who had power given them by Chriſt to work theſe things, <hi>Acts</hi> 16.18. <hi>Acts</hi> 2.4 <hi>Acts</hi> 28.5.8. theſe things do teſtifie that Jeſus was riſen, and that his promiſe was made manifeſt, who promiſed to come again, and to manifeſt himſelf unto them that believed, and to ſend the ſpirit which was the Comforter, and to indue them, that waited upon him with power, who ſaid <hi>he that is with you ſhall be in you;</hi> and ſo the ſheep of Chriſt were ſcattered to their own, to wit, his gift which was in them; they came to receive and feel his power and ſpirit to lead them into all truth; and this many thouſands do and ſhall witneſs that the ſpirit of truth is their leader into all truth, and thus though Chriſt be exalted far above the heavens, yet he doth ſo far condeſcend unto them that believe in his name, that he becomes their leader, a light to them that have ſat in darkneſs, to lead them out of darkneſs, and a ſeed to ſuch as have been barren that they may bring forth fruit in him, to the praiſe of his everlaſting Name in whom is the life, <hi>which life is the light of men</hi> that doth enlighten every man that cometh into the world; and Chriſt ſaid unto his Diſciples, verily, <hi>verily I ſay unto you, he that believeth on me, the works that I do ſhall he do alſo, and greater works then theſe ſhall he do becauſe I go unto my Father, Joh.</hi> 14.12. and Chriſt ſaid unto his Father concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing them that he ſent forth, <hi>as thou haſt ſent me into world, ſo I ſend them into the world,</hi> and thus he made manifeſt his power and gifts in his people, as he doth in this day in theſe that believe in him, for the ſame power that he gave unto his Diſciples, the ſame
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:173004:25"/>he giveth unto his ſervants now; according to the ſeveral gifts and manifeſtations committed unto them, that they may come to the meaſure of the ſtature of his fulneſs, and to a perfect man in him, and that they may feel, handle, taſte of and injoy Chriſt who is glorified in that glory which he had with the Father before the world was, and now by his power many do witheſs, that the power of the Serpent the prince of the world is overcome, and the ſick are healed, and the blinde are brought to ſee, and the deaf to hear, and the lame to walk, and even ſuch as have been dead in treſpaſſes and ſins are quickened and raiſed up and brought to live with Chriſt in newneſs of life, and ſuch have an intereſt in the death of Chriſt being made con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formable thereto, in that they are crucified with Chriſt; and dead with him to the world, and to the evil wayes, faſhions, cuſtoms, rudiments and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formities of the world, ſo as the the vail of the Temple was rent, and the dead was raiſed, when Chriſt ſuffered; they that feel his power made ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifeſt, and with it are brought to ſuffer with Chriſt, they feel the vail that hath ſeperated them from his glory, rent; and in his light are come to ſee light, and in his blood which is his life, they are brought to feel life, and his witneſſs is raiſed and his ſeed is come to live, as he hath promiſed <hi>the hour is coming and now is, when the dead ſhall hear the voyce of the Son of God, and they that hear ſhall live, John</hi> 5.25. and this is truely witneſſed among many that have believed in the light of the Lord Jeſus, praiſes, praiſes to his holy name for ever and ever; But they that deny the light of Chriſt within peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple to be ſufficient to lead them to Chriſt, and will not own Chriſt within them, according to his pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe to his, but are looking and gazing abroad in their imaginations, imagining a Chriſt like them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves,
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:173004:25"/>and for ſalvation afar off, and Juſtification afar off, and yet they are in their ſins, and believe not that they ſhal be otherwiſe ſo long as they live upon earth, they are ſtrangers to the true Chriſt, and to his righteouſneſs, and their minds are from that which Juſtifieth, and comes not to ſee theſe things which Chriſt did in his own perſon, fulfilled in his Kingdom, as the Saints did, who were tranſlated into the Kingdom of Chriſt, which ſtood in his power, who knew Chriſt in them and his Kingdom in them, and ſo they whoſe minds are out from the light, who are gazing from it, and will not own the coming of Chriſt within, nor a juſtifying by his righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs within, the cloud of darkneſs is over them; that they cannot ſee Chriſt in his power, as they who were gazing when Jeſus was taken from them they could ſee no further then the cloud which received him out of their ſight, <hi>but Stephen who was full of the holy Ghoſt he ſaw the heaven open, and the glory of God, and the Son of man on the right hand of God;</hi> and <hi>John</hi> who witneſſed the light within him, and the ſpirit of God and Chriſt, who is the light the quickening ſpirit revealed in him, he ſaw the heaven open, and they that walked in the light, of Chriſt in them, they witneſſed his righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs revealed in them, and thereby are Juſtified from their ſins, and not in their ſins; for no fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther are any ſanctified nor juſtified then they feel themſelves made holy and juſt by Chriſt in his righteouſneſs in them, and no further are they juſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied by Chriſt then they are made partakers of the life of Chriſt in them; for Juſtification is a real work of God in that creature that feels a ſanctifying or cleanſing from ſin; ſo ve that ſay ye are juſtified by Chriſts ſuffering without you above 1600. years ſince, and yet you continue in ſin and would lay all your iniquities upon Chriſts back, you are of them

<pb n="47" facs="tcp:173004:26"/>life is his light, (the light of men) and he dyed for all, that as many as live, ſhould not live unto them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>themſelves but unto him who dyed and roſe again, and they who are dead unto ſin are healed by his ſtripes; But they who live to ſin are enemies to the Croſſe of Chriſt, (which is the power of God unto ſalvation, to the true believers) and theſe that are enemies to the Croſſe are they by whom Chriſt ſuffers, and theſe who diſwade people from heeding or following the light within, which Chriſt hath enlightened them withall, they are even ſuch as keeps Chriſt in priſon, and ſuch watchmen as are blind, and ignorant, ſuch as they were that watched the Tomb where the body of Jeſus laid (that he might not riſe) yea, theſe Prieſts now are worſe then they were then whom the chief Prieſts hired to lie touching Jeſus, that people might not believe that he was riſen; for theſe were not ſuch hypocrites as theſe Prieſts are now, for people blind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly hires them to Preach Chriſt now, &amp; they profeſſe to do it, but directs them from the light within, ſo that they are ſtill in death, having no part in his life or Reſurrection whilſt their minds are kept from his life, which is the light of men, and ſuch Prieſts were alwaies enemies to Chriſt, and <hi>Judas</hi> that turned to the Prieſts betrayed and ſold the innocent into the hands of the Prieſts and murtherers, for thirty pieces of ſilver, and with it they bought but one field; but theſe Prieſts now who teach for hire, do make a trade of theſe Scriptures, and ſells the Letter of the Scriptures, &amp; with much money, they have thus un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>juſtly gotten, many of them have bought many fields or Lands; ſo their wickedneſs doth in this exceed the wickedneſs of <hi>Judas,</hi> and them who purchaſed but one field to bury ſtrangers in; and this ground they thus bought was not to live upon, but to bury ſtrangers in, but theſe Prieſts now many of them do
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:173004:27"/>live of the earth or fields they purchaſe with the money they get for their preaching Chriſt, (as they pretend) and they that crucified Chriſt, they took his garments and parted them; and ſo theſe coveteous Prieſts, they get Chriſts words and make a Trade upon them, but him they crucifie a freſh through theſe their horrible crimes and wickedneſs, and ſo betrayes the juſt and watches to keep his life in the priſon and in the grave, for as much as they labour to keep people from following <hi>his light within them,</hi> for they are afraid that it ſhould diſcover their deceits, for the light maketh mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſt things that are reproved, and the Apoſtle cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led the proud and the covetous teachers Traytors, 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 3.2 3.4. So let theſe Traytors (and all that turn from the life of Chriſt within) to the deceit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful Prieſts without who makes a trade on Chriſts words, and keeps the ſeed of God in bondage, and his life, which is the light, they watch the graves to keep it in; remember <hi>Judas</hi> his end how he hanged himſelf, how he thus fell into diſparation, and remember that the Angel of the Lord ſmote them that watched to keep Jeſus in the grave or tomb, that theſe watchmen were made to ſhake for fear, and became as dead men, and theſe watch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men who thus watch againſt the light of Chriſt <hi>(which enlighteneth every man that cometh into the world)</hi> the Lord God will ſmite them, that they will be made to ſhake and quake for all their filthy crimes one day, though now they deſpiſe Quaking, and deſpiſes him that God regardeth who trembleth at his word; And remember that Chriſt he called them graves that appeared not, and painted Sepul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chres, who had gotten the true Prophets words, but were out of the Prophets life, in the pride and hypocrifie; and may we not call theſe teachers graves now who profefeſſe the Scriptures to be

And let people that follow them and ſeek for help among them, note, that they <hi>are but ſeeking the living among the dead;</hi> and are but ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king life among the graves, and whited Sepulchres; who have gotten the words of the Scripture, but the life lies buryed in them; and know that that man that kept among the dead mens tombes, or graves, was not led by the ſpirit of truth, but was poſſeſſed with an unclean ſpirit; and is it not an unclean ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit of error that makes ſo many people keep among theſe filthy graves and tombes, whoſe out-ſide is whited with an empty profeſhion, but their inſide is full of rottenneſſe and ravening?

                  <p>It is written in the book of <hi>Iohn,</hi> that <hi>many other ſigns truly did Jeſus in the preſence of his diſciples, which are not written in this book, but theſe are written that ye might believe that Jeſus is the Chriſt, the Son of God, that believing ye might have life through his Name, Iohn</hi> 20.30, 31. Alſo it is written that <hi>there are alſo ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny other things which Jeſus did, the which if they ſhould be written every one,</hi> I ſuppoſe <hi>that even the world it ſelf could not containe the books that ſhould be written, A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, Iohn</hi> 21.25. Indeed the whole world lieth in wickedneſſe, and are reproved by the ſpirit of truth, becauſe they believe not in Chriſt whom the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture doth teſtifie of; So that, If all things that Chriſt did, and ſpoke, were written, the world it ſelf could not contain them, for they truly do not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain theſe things that are already written of Chriſt; for as much as they are ignorant of Chriſt, and his light; and many hypocrites had the Prophets words that propheſied of Chriſt, but knew not Chriſt; but perſecuted him when he came; &amp; many there are now, who are both ignorant of the power of God, and of the Scriptures.

And every creditor was to releaſe the debts owing them, and they that had their lands or eſtates morgaged for debt were to have them releaſed, that every man might poſſeſſe his own in the year of the Sabbath; but the everlaſting Sabbath they were not then come to; For they had often fightings and war with their enemies, who ſought to oppreſſe them, <hi>Gen.</hi> 2.2. <hi>Exo.</hi> 16.23. and 20.8.11. and 31.15. and 35.2. <hi>Levit.</hi> 23.3. and 35.3. <hi>Num.</hi> 15 <hi>Deut:</hi> 5.14. <hi>Neh:</hi> 10.31. <hi>Jer.</hi> 17.21. <hi>Exo.</hi> 21.2. and 23.10, 11. <hi>Levit.</hi> 25. <hi>Deut.</hi> 15.2.12. <hi>Jer.</hi> 34.14.</p>

And the year or time of releaſe or reſtauration comes to be witneſsed, and the Bedemption from under the bon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dages and the burthens known, and the Iniquity which hath cauſed burthens is there taken away by the Lord of the Sabboth, who is the foundation of many Generations, who is raiſed up to him that ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth the Sabboth his delight, and doth not his own

                  <p>THe firſt Covenant and Prieſthood had a Taber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nacle of the Congregation which was made ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the pattern which God ſhewed unto <hi>Moſes</hi> in the mount, and made known unto him how to make the Tabernacle, and inſtruments there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, and there was the Ordinances of Divine Service, and this Tabernacle had the worldly ſanctuary
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:173004:36"/>or outward Court called the ſanctuary where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in the Prieſts did dayly ſervice, as offering ſacrifices, and offerings for the ſins and treſpaſſes of the people; And there was ſeven Lamps continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally burning, and within the Tabernacle was there a ſecond vail hung up; and within that vail was the the Tabernacle called the moſt holy, wherein was the Cherubims mercy-ſeat, and the Ark of the Teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony that God gave to <hi>Moſes,</hi> the Teſtimony was in the Ark; the mercy-ſeat was over the Ark, and the Cherubims, ſtood over the mercy ſeat on each end of it, with their wings ſtretched forth over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhadowing the mercy-ſeat, and none was to go into the moſt holy place within the vail, ſave the high Prieſt once a year, but he went not without blood which he offered for his own ſins, and for the errors of the people; and the Lord communed with the Prieſt from between the Cherubims of glory, and yet neither the Prieſt nor the people were made pure as pertaining to the conſcience, by theſe of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferings and Ordinances which they offered and up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>held in that Covenant which had a ſhadow of hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venly things; ſo that there was need of a ſecond Covenant, and of the blood of the heavenly Media<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor whereby a cleanſing from ſin and error is wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſed by ſuch as have received the end of theſe outward ſhadows, which in their time was glorious. But now (mark) this figure in the firſt covenant, the Ark of the Teſtimony was under the mercy-ſeat which was over ſhadowed with the Cheribins; And both the Ark and the mercy-ſeat was within the vail; whether the people that was in the error and hardneſs of heart might not come, ſave the Prieſt that was annointed with pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious ointment; for in this holy place was the golden cenſer, alſo the golden pot which had the Manna, and <hi>Aarons</hi> rod which budded, and the

And which he makes known, and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formes with his people who receive his Teſtimony, which is the ſpirit of prophecy within them, and witneſs his witneſs, his Law and Judgments within, and here they feel the mercy ſeat in the heavenly Tabernacle ſet open, and the Vaile taken from off their hearts, and in ſtead of hardneſs and ſtoney hearts he gives them an heart of fleſh, an heart to know the Lord according to his promiſe, and this
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:173004:37"/>was more then many knew, while the Tabernacle of mans pitching was ſtanding; for what was upheld in that Tabernacle was but a figure or ſhadow of the heavenly Tabernacle, wherein the Lord is heard by all his people, and his worſhip in the ſpirit is known, which his Light leades them to which gives them underſtanding, and cauſeth their Lamps to burn, and fitteth them for the Lord, that he makes his abode with them, whoſe foundation ſtands ſure, and Tabernacle ſhall not be removed.

<pb n="70" facs="tcp:173004:38"/>was ſprinkled on the Altar, and on the people for their Conſecration after they had treſpaſſed. And the offerings that were made by fire, were for a ſweet Savour unto God, and thereby his command for a time was fulfilled, and his wrath appeaſed; but theſe things did not purifie the people, nor the blood of Bulls and Goats, nor the Aſhes of an Heifer cleanſe the people, as pertaining to the conſcience, for as there was dayly offerings made for ſin, there was dayly a conſcience remaining of their ſin, and almoſt all things by the Law was purged with blood; ſo all the many offerings and the divers waſhings, and cleanſings that were in the firſt Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant, did neither bring the people into inward cleanneſs, nor to perſection as pertaining to their inward ſtate, <hi>Exod</hi> 19.10, 18. <hi>Levit.</hi> 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9. <hi>Chap.

                  <p>But now in the fulneſs of time according to the promiſes of God whereon the ſecond Covenant is eſtabliſhed, God hath made manifeſt his own begot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten Son, who hath offered himſelf a Lamb without fault to God, and by his blood he cleanſeth them that beleeve in him from all ſin, and he is the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pitiation for the ſins of the whole world, through faith in his blood, which is his life, which he hath laid down and revealed in the ſaints.

                  <p>IN the time of the firſt Covenant and the law of Commandments contained in carnal Ordinances the <hi>Iſraelites</hi> and <hi>Jewes</hi> had the law read among them every Sabbath day to put them in mind of it,

But here is not a telling that a Miniſter of the Goſpel is to ſtand up in a Pulpit in a Steeple<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>houſe, and preach half a day from a Text of Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture, as many now do who profeſſe themſelves to be Miniſters of the Goſpel, and ſay they are not under the Law, and yet are pleading for pulpits and giving their ſences to the Scriptures, <hi>Nehe.</hi> 8, 3, 4.5, 6, 7, 8, <hi>Ezra.</hi> 3, 1, &amp; 7, 6. <hi>Deut.</hi> 17, 19, &amp; 31, 11.</p>
                  <p>And moreover the reading of the Law was con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued among the <hi>Jewes</hi> every Sabbath day in their Synagogues; when they were in Rebellion and envy againſt Chriſt in the dayes of his fleſh; never<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theleſs, their reading of the law being before Chriſt was crucified, people were to do theſe things they commanded (according to the law) but not after their wicked works, for they were enemies to Chriſt, though they had the law and ſate in <hi>Moſes</hi> ſeat, <hi>Acts</hi> 13, 27, &amp; 15, 21. <hi>Mat.</hi> 23, 1, 2, 3.</p>
                  <p>Now in the ſecond Covenant and Prieſthood he is not a <hi>Jew</hi> thats one outward, but he is a <hi>Jew</hi> thats one inward, whoſe praiſe is not of men, but of God, neither are they all <hi>Iſrael</hi> which are of <hi>Iſrael</hi> accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the fleſh, but they are true <hi>Iſraelites</hi> who have received the Covenant of God within, and his law within; who are come to know the Miniſtration of the ſpirit which in glory exceedeth the miniſtration of death written (or the law without which was read to the people) though in its time it was glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious: but the Miniſtration of the ſpirit (which the

And we are not Miniſters of the letter but of the ſpirit, and of the New Teſtament which Chriſt is the Mediator of, that people may come to ſee and hear the righteous law of God and and his light within them, and they may not be forgetfull thereof any more, but know Chriſt the Mediator, in whoſe hand the law is held, and by whoſe power it is executed upon the ground of the offences within; and it muſt come in Judgement up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the head of all them that are wreſting the Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptures and pleading now for their own ſences upon the Scriptures, and propheſies of the Scriptures, who alſo are pleading for the chiefeſt places in the Aſſemblies, as the pulpits, and high places ſuch did Chriſt cry often wo againſt; But we have learned the example of Chriſt Jeſus who was meek and lowly in heart, and taught meekneſs and lowlineſs, and he that would be the greateſt among his, was to be ſervant to all.
